# Blackjack card game

## Overview

Blackjack is a simple, popular card game that is played in many casinos. During a hand of Blackjack, the players plays against a dealer with the goal of building a hand whose value is higher than the value of the dealer's hand, but not over 21. (The player is said to have busted in this case). Cards in Blackjack have the following values: an ace may be valued as either 1 or 11 (player's choice), face cards are valued at 10 and the value of the remaining cards corresponds to their number.

The game logic for this _simplified_ version of Blackjack is as follows:

- The player and the dealer are each dealt two cards initially with one of the dealer's cards being dealt faced down (his hole card).
- The player may then ask for the dealer to repeatedly "hit" his hand by dealing him another card.
- If at any point the value of the player's hand exceeds 21, the player is "busted" and loses immediately.
- At any point prior to busting, the player may "stand" and the dealer will then expose his hole card and hit his hand until the value of his hand is 17 or more. (Aces count as 11 unless it causes the dealer's hand to bust).
- If the dealer busts, the player wins. Otherwise, the player and dealer then compare the values of their hands and the hand with the higher value wins.
- The dealer wins ties in this version.
